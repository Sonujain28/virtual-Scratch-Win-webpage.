Project Title:
# Shree Om Mobile Repairing Center – Scratch & Win Web App

# Description:
This project is an interactive “Scratch &amp; Win” web page developed for Shree Om Mobile Repairing Center, designed to engage customers and promote the shop’s services.It combines a responsive HTML/CSS front-end with JavaScript logic for the scratch card effect and prize generation.

The home page showcases the shop’s branding, working hours, services (screen replacement, battery replacement, charging port repair, water damage treatment, IC-level work, accessories sales), and contact details with quick links for WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.

The “Scratch & Win” feature uses an HTML5 <canvas> to create a scratch-off surface over a randomized prize image. A prize pool with common rewards (mobile stands, cable protectors, earphones, screen guards, mobile skins) and rare rewards (earbuds, neckbands) is generated through probability logic, including “Better luck next time” outcomes. The user scratches by clicking and dragging, with live progress tracking (Scratched: X%). Once 100% is revealed, the prize image and text are displayed. 

One of the key features of this project is the QR code integration. Using Python, we generated a QR code that converts the entire webpage into a scannable code. This allows users to open the webpage directly on their devices with just a single scan, making access faster and more convenient.

The project is deployed on Netlify, which hosts the webpage online. Netlify ensures that the web application is accessible anywhere, without requiring users to download any files or run local servers.
